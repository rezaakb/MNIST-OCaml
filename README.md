# MNIST-OCaml

## Description

This project involves the development of a basic neural network from scratch, implemented in OCaml. The neural network is built without the use of any pre-existing machine learning libraries, offering insights into the foundational elements of neural network creation and training. The model is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset to assess its performance and effectiveness.

## Getting Started
Ensure that OCaml is installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the detailed installation instructions available [here](https://gowthamk.github.io/csci7000_pfp_s23/resources/).

### Dataset Setup
- Download the MNIST dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OybjWb-8KmQ7cdopfjRhtMuPOj9We4HG/view?usp=sharing).
- Extract and move the dataset to the `data/` folder.

### Usage
The primary implementation and usage details are provided in the `main.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Follow the steps and code snippets in the notebook for a comprehensive guide on how to train and evaluate the neural network using the MNIST dataset.
